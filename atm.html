        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>ATM has helped me and my family a lot(I help them when they need to know something about technology). I have learned many new and helpful things about technology and computers the past 3 years. It is a great program that it helps me in many ways. The knowledge I have from ATM sometimes helps me at home and with other classes when we are doing somthing on the internet or something that has technology involved in it.
