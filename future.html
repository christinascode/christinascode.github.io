        <h2>Highschool</h2>
        <p>The high school I would like to go to is Riverside Poly High School. I am not going to any high schools in Long Beach because iâ€™m moving out to Riverside and it would be really hard and a waste of gas for my parents to drive me out here every day.
</p>

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p> I don't know what college I want to go to, but I know want to attend a college. I'll probably also go to a college out in Riveside because we'll most likely still be living out there. I want to go to a college that will help exceed in my learning and my future.

        <h2>Career Interests</h2>
        <p> I don't know what I want my career to be yet, but I know I want to have a career that gets paid a good amount of money and that will help my family and I to move forwards. But two thigs I would consider going into is a doctor and lawyer. Both of those look interesting to do and go into.</p>
