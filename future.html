        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>I play soccer all the time. I also sometimes cook when i’m in the mood. When i’m really bored and have nothing else to do I tend to draw. I like to listen to music all the time and when I dont see somthing like right or in place I tend to make erything neat and put everything in its place.</p>

        <h2>Career Interests</h2>
        <p>I am the middle child in my family. I have an older brother named Santiago and a younger brother named Diego. My family is really close, we tell eachother everything. Both of my parents are from Mexico. My mom came to the United states with her family when she was around 5 years old and my dad came with his family when he was 17 years old. We normally do everything together. We are really close and we tell eachother everything.</p>
