        <h2>Positions</h2>
        <p>There are four positions in to play in soccer. There is Goalie, the only one allowed to use thier hands while playing and block all the balls from going into the goal. Then defence, just defends to goalie and help to not let the ball go inside the goal and you block the forwards. Middle, you help the defence out and you help the forwards out.
