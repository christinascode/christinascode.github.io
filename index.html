        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I work very well in groups and I am very dependable. My gpa has always been in the range of 3.8-4.0 and it has never been lower than that. I always get my stuff turned in on time and I always have to make sure everything is perfect. I am good at helping others with problems, whenever others have any problems then tend to come to me for advice and help. I can also cook. I have many skills in technology because I have been in ATM for the past three years.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I play soccer all the time. I also sometimes cook when i’m in the mood. When i’m really bored and have nothing else to do I tend to draw. I like to listen to music all the time and when I dont see somthing like right or in place I tend to make erything neat and put everything in its place.</p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I am the middle child in my family. I have an older brother named Santiago and a younger brother named Diego. My family is really close, we tell eachother everything. Both of my parents are from Mexico. My mom came to the United states with her family when she was around 5 years old and my dad came with his family when he was 17 years old. We normally do everything together. We are really close and we tell eachother everything.</p>
